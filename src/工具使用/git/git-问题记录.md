# Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.

```shell

```

# github.com port 22: Connection timed out

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:xxxxx/xxxx.git my-awesome-proj
Cloning into 'my-awesome-proj'...
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

$ # This should also timeout
$ ssh -T git@github.com
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out

$ # but this might work
$ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com

IdentityFile C:/Users/drenc/.ssh/id_rsa # 自己的地址
```
